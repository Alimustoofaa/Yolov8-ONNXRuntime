# Yolov8-ONNXRuntime

be used to perform object detection using a pre-trained YOLOv8n model in ONNX format. onnxruntime provides a flexible and high-performance runtime engine for executing deep learning models in production environments, and supports a wide range of hardware platforms and execution providers. The code also shows how the output of the model can be processed to extract the bounding boxes and class labels of the detected objects, which can be used for a variety of downstream applications, such as tracking, counting, or recognition.
